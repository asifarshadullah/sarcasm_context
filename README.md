# sarcasm_context
Role of conversation context for sarcasm detection. Three sets of data is used.
(1) IAC_V2 (check here - https://nlds.soe.ucsc.edu/sarcasm2). Note, this corpus has only the 1/2 of the corpus used in Oraby et al. 2016 (SIGDIAL 2016).
(2) A snapshot of Reddit posts (50K instances; collected from Khodak et al. 2018; http://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/SARC/2.0/). We have selected the corpus based on the # of sentences in context as well as sarcastic posts. The data is available here.
(3) Twitter dialogue of 26K utterances. TODO - some preprocessing before releasing the data.
